# Inertia Labs — Zero Knowledge Research & Engineering
Inertia Labs is a personal research group led by Andy Bell focused on zkVM systems, 
execution environments, and verifiable computation.

Areas of exploration:
- zkVM architecture
- Execution trace modeling
- Constraint system design
- Static analysis for ZK
- STARK vs SNARK VM trade-offs
- Cryptographic primitives (Arkworks, Schnorr circuits)
- Cairo & STARK-based execution
