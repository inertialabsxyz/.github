# Inertia Labs — Systems Research & Engineering

Inertia Labs is an independent R&D space led by Andy Bell. I build and document practical systems at the intersection of **AI agent architectures**, **Rust**, and **Web3 primitives** (coordination, identity, trust), with continued interest in **verifiable computation / ZK** where it meaningfully improves system guarantees.

## Current through-line
**AI agents + coordination**: designing practical agent systems where blockchains are used only for what they’re good at (coordination, identity, trust, settlement) — not for compute.

## Areas of exploration
- **Agent systems in Rust** (tool use, memory, evaluation, reliability)
- **Retrieval & knowledge systems** (RAG as a foundational agent capability)
- **Agent identity, trust, and provenance**
- **Coordination patterns** (task markets, verification, dispute handling; hybrid on/off-chain architectures)
- **Verifiable computation / ZK** (selective use for auditability and guarantees, not novelty)

## How to read this org
Most repos are “lab notebooks”: prototypes, experiments, and write-ups. Some will be polished; many are intentionally exploratory.

## Starting points
- `rag-my-pdf` — minimal RAG over PDFs in Rust (Rig), used as a baseline to explore agent memory + grounding.
- `zkvm-merkle-comparison` — comparative zkVM work (when relevant to guarantees / verification).
